          <h1>Spaghetti Carbonara</h1>
          <p>Inexpensive, vegetarian, and delicious Pupusas are perfect for a casual weekday dinner. Pupusas are a stuffed cornmeal flatbread native to El Salvador and Honduras. 
          The shreaded cabbage paired with the pan-fried bread gives this dish a lovely texture, and the Salsa Rosa adds warmth and depth of flavor.

      <h2>Spaghetti Carbonara</h2>
      <ul class="recipe" id="recipe-block-carbonara">
        <li>4 slices uncooked Bacon</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp red pepper flakes</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cream</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic (1-2 clove)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Butter (room temperature)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/4 cup shredded Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 lb Spagetti (2-3 quarter-sized bundles)</li>
        <li></li>
      </ul>
      
      <p class="cookInstruct"> Bring water to a boil in a large pot then cook the Spagetti. Warm a oven safe dish in oven at 200 degrees.
      Cook bacon until crispy and set aside. Discard half the bacon grease, add red pepper flakes to the remaining grease and remove from heat to cool.
      Add cream and garlic to the grease and bring to a low simmer. Drain pasta and place in the warm oven safe dish with the butter, stir until the noodles are evenly coated and return to oven.
      Combine cheese and eggs in a mixing bowl and set aside. Cut bacon into small bits and add to the cream mixture. Pour the cream mixture over the noodles and mix until noodles are evenly coated. 
      Pour the cheese and egg mixture over the noodles and mix. Serve and enjoy. <b>Note:</b> Adding the egg mixture last will allow the eggs to cook a little without causing them to scramble ruining the dish's creamy texture.
